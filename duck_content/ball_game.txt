Every player has the same weapon:
"Charge beam weapon name McDuck"

Able to press the fire button to charge the weapon (up to 100%).
Like a laser, with no bounce. More charge == more power.
If aimed at a surface, self propel instead (like instashield lasers). # Or maybe always self-propel? Could be interesting to test out.
When hitting an enemy, does 1 damage, push enemy in the direction of the beam.
More power == larger beam, more propulsion.

Each player has a rechargeable shield. # Visible shield bubble
Blocks 1 damage. # Should it block beam push as well?
Recharges after X seconds. Let's say 5.

Each player has 1 health.
When a player's health reaches 0, becomes "stunned".
Stunned == extremely slowed down, no hook, no shooting, no jump. # Electrified effect
Stun status lasts X seconds. Try 2-3s at first.

There is a ball and 2 goals, one for each team. Goal could be a circle.

The ball.
Is not subjected to gravity.
Bounces on walls.
Friction with air/walls. So it decelerates all the time and additionally when bouncing on walls.

When a player touches the ball, he "grabs" it.
The ball enter its "Charge beam weapon name McDuck". # Visually changes to indicate the player has the ball.
The weapon then changes functionality.
Firing it launches the ball. More power == more ball speed.
The weapon reverts back to laser beam after the player shoots the ball.

The ball can be shot by laser beams to alter its course.

If a player is shot with the ball while his shield is down, the ball shoots automatically. # Speed will have to be tinkered with here.

When the ball touches a goal, the opposing team gains a point, the game states then resets.

The game starts with the ball in the center (or wherever the map designer put it).
Players all spawn and are frozen and invulnerable. Hook is possible, as well as shooting.
A countdown starts. 5..4..3..2..1..0.
All players become no longer frozen / invulnerable, the game begins.
